Leaf - Demo Engine
==================

Leaf is a demo engine, mainly done as a fun side project, and used to
release [demos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demo_(computer_programming))
at demoparty events.

You can find more information on the project page: [http://leaf.graphics](http://leaf.graphics)

Licensing
---------

I work on this project on my spare time and don't plan on earning any money from it,
so feel free to use the code however you want. It's licensed under the permissive MIT
license (see the LICENSE file for details).

Contributing
------------

I won't accept pull requests for the moment (maybe later!). Right now, the goal is not
to make a huge open source project, but to have fun shipping demos :)

Still, even if the engine is far from perfect or complete, maybe looking at the code
can be useful, especially if you want to dig in a smaller codebase than other engines
out there, so feel free to explore or take whatever you want from here!

Also, I would love to know if you found something useful here, or if you used the
engine or some of its code in your project, just let me know! (no obligation though)

Please also let me know if you have feedback, found bugs, or think my code is nonsense,
I'd love to hear about it :)
